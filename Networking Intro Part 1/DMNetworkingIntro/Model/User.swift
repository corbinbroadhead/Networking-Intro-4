/**
 2.1 For this project, we will be working with **only the "/users" endpoint**. The JSON you get back from this endpoint will contain many keys, but we care about only the "data" key. The value for this key is an array of several JSON objects representing fake users.
 
 Familiarize yourself with the documentation for the endpoint: https://reqres.in/api-docs/#/default/get_users. Do not move on until you until you're comfortable with the data you'll get back.
 
 2.2 Based on the JSON, create a struct called `User` that conforms to the `Codable` protocol and contains the following properties:
    - An Int `id`
    - A String `email`
    - A String `firstName`
    - A String `lastName`
    - a String `avatar`
 
 2.3 Create a separate structure called `UserResponse` that also conforms to `Codable` and contains a single `[User]` called data.

struct User: Codable {
    var id: Int
    var email: String
    var firstName: String
    var lastName: String
    var avatar: String
}

struct UserResponse: Codable {
    var data: [User]
}
